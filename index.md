### Hi there!

It all started with a challenge from my friend, Nhi. She challenged me to write about what I learned in the last 2 months in 600 words. Instead of diving into writing, I spent 2 days on creating this blogging website. Who knows, I may need a place to store bunch of my writings in the future, or I may end up with 1 post. We will see.

I am interested in programming, especially competitive programming. Well, I am currently a newbie, but my goal is to become red on Codeforces. So most of my posts here will be my summaries or reviews about algorithms/data structures I learned, and interesting problems I encountered. Mainly I write for myself. If you find my posts helpful then great!

I am not an expert in programming, so there may be some flaws here and there. If you notice any, please feel free to create a pull request by clicking `Edit this page on GitHub` at the bottom of the post that needs to be fixed.

Thank you for visiting!
