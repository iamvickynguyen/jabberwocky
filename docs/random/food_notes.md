### Carbohydrates

- Carbohydrates contain glucose, which is converted into energy. It supports physical activities.
- Healthy carbohydrates: whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans
- Unhealthy carbohydrates: white bread, pastries, sodas, and other highly processed or refined foods.

### Protein

- Our body do not store protein and you may not need as much as you think
- Protein helps build and repair tissue; It makes up the enzymes which aids digesting food, and powers many chemical reactions and hemoglobin which carries oxygen in our blood.
- We need at least 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight per day, or just over 7 grams for every 20 pounds of body weight.
- Good: legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, whole grains, and other plant-based sources of protein
- Also good: poultry (chicken, turkey, duck), seafood (fish, crustaceans, mollusks), eggs
- Not so good: red meat (beef, pork), and processed meats (bacon, sausages)
