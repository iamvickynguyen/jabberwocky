### Carbohydrates

- Carbohydrates contain glucose, which is converted into energy. It supports physical activities.
- Healthy carbohydrates: whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans
- Unhealthy carbohydrates: white bread, pastries, sodas, and other highly processed or refined foods.

#### Fiber

- A type of carbohydrate that our body cannot digest. It cannot be broken down into sugar molecules.
- Fiber helps control blood sugar and hunger.
- Soluble fiber (dissolves in water) helps lower glucose levels and blood cholesterol:  oatmeal, nuts, beans, lentils, apples and blueberries
- Insoluble fiber (does not dissolve in water) helps food move through your digestive system:  wheat, whole wheat bread, whole grain couscous, brown rice, legumes, carrots, cucumbers and tomatoes

### Protein

- Our body do not store protein and you may not need as much as you think
- Protein helps build and repair tissue; It makes up the enzymes which aids digesting food, and powers many chemical reactions and hemoglobin which carries oxygen in our blood.
- We need at least 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight per day, or just over 7 grams for every 20 pounds of body weight.
- Good: legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, whole grains, and other plant-based sources of protein
- Also good: poultry (chicken, turkey, duck), seafood (fish, crustaceans, mollusks), eggs
- Not so good: red meat (beef, pork), and processed meats (bacon, sausages)

### Fats and Cholesterol

- Oils and fats supply calories, and they help our body absorb fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E and K
- "Good" unsaturated fats: vegetable oils (such as olive, canola, sunflower, soy, and corn), nuts, seeds, and fish
- "Bad" fats - trans fats: processed foods (shortening margarine, cakes, anything fried)
- Saturated fats: not as harmful as trans fat: red meat, butter, cheese, ice cream, plant-based fats (coconut oil, palm oil)

### Water

- Very important. It keeps body working properly, helps your body flush wastes and stay at the right temperature, etc.
- Drink 1.5L or 2L water or other fluid every day. Also depends on the amount of exercise
- Limit to 750mL black coffee or 1L of black tea
